# Social-network-models
This is a toy model of a social networks with influential nodes,
based on the networkx package(https://networkx.org/).

The nodes update their opinions based on the interactions with other nodes.
The influential have higher influence over other nodes, 
and also have a certain robustness towards the influence of other nodes.
This is an extension of the Confidence-Bound model of social interaction:

Hegselmann, R., & Krause, U. (2002). Opinion dynamics and bounded confidence models, analysis, and simulation. Journal of artificial societies and social simulation, 5(3).


The opinions are visualized through a histogram or network structure.
